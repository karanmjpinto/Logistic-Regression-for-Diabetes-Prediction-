Pandas help read and manipulate the data. Numpy converts the data into a format suitable for the classification model.  
Seaborn and Matplotlib have been used for visualisations.  
Sklearn is used to import Logistic Regressions to build the classification model and save it for future use. 

The data is explored, prepared (split & normalized) and the ML model is trained, evaluated and interpreted.

Next steps is to explore Feature Engineering techniques to reduce noise endured by the ML algorithms and enhance performance.
